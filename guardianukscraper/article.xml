<items><item><body><value>Theresa May’s draft “snooper’s charter” bill fails to cover all the intrusive spying powers of the security agencies and lacks clarity in its privacy protections, a parliamentary committee has said.</value><value>The intelligence and security committee said the draft legislation published by the home secretary suffered from a lack of sufficient time and preparation. It was evident that even those working on the legislation had not always been clear about what it was intended to achieve, it said. </value><value>The unexpectedly critical intervention by the ISC, which is nominated by the prime minister and chaired by the former Conservative attorney general, Dominic Grieve, comes just two days before a key scrutiny committee of MPs and peers is to deliver its verdict on the draft legislation aimed at regulating the surveillance powers of the security agencies.</value><value>The draft investigatory powers bill will include new powers for the security agencies to access the web browsing histories of UK citizens for up to 12 months, as well as establishing a fresh legal framework for their existing capabilities to track web and phone use and engage in computer hacking.</value><value>The ISC said in its report that it supported the government’s intention to provide greater transparency around the security services’ intrusive powers in the aftermath of the Edward Snowden mass surveillance disclosures.</value><value>“It is nevertheless disappointing that the draft bill does not cover all the agencies’ intrusive capabilities – as the committee recommended last year,” Grieve said.</value><value>“This means that the various powers and authorisations remain scattered throughout different pieces of legislation and, as a result, the draft bill is limited in the extent to which it can provide a comprehensive legal framework. In our view it is a missed opportunity.”</value><value>The report said the bill failed to deliver the clarity needed in this area. </value><value>While the issues involved were undoubtedly complex, Grieve said, “it has been evident that even those working on the legislation have not always been clear as to what the provisions are intended to be”.</value><value>The committee members said they had expected to find universal privacy protections at the forefront of the bill but instead a piecemeal approach had been taken which “lacks clarity and undermines the importance of safeguards associated with these powers”. They suggest dedicated privacy protections be included to form the backbone of the legislation and ensure privacy was not just an add-on.</value><value>“Given the background to the draft bill and the public concern over the allegations made by Edward Snowden in 2013, it is surprising that the protection of people’s privacy – which is enshrined in other legislation – does not feature more prominently,” they said. </value><value>The ISC proposed three other major changes to the bill:</value><value>“We consider these changes necessary if the government is to bring forward legislation which provides the security and intelligence agencies with the investigatory powers they require, while protecting our privacy through robust safeguards and controls,” Grieve said.</value></body><author>Alan Travis</author><title>

He had already given up chairing the ISC.</value><value>The UK Government/GCHQ are going even more rogue with their surveillance and hacking powers. What a free-for-all against human privacy rights. All technology companies need to leave the UK and get out from under the smothering invasion of privacy.</value><value>Teresa May - must try harder, shabby work like this is unacceptable.</value><value>Bigger picture: More and more people awakening and questioning the corrupt and criminal political system. Corrupt and criminal political system invents new invasive ways of spy on everyone while soon no doubt broadening the definition of a 'terrorist' as anyone questioning the corrupt and criminal political system. Also, how quickly people forget that after every single recent false flag event of terror, the ringleaders and perpetrators are always seemingly known or have been followed by intelligence agencies. Wake up and smell the bullshit. </value><value>"Everybody's worried about stopping terrorism. Well, there's a really easy way: stop participating in it." - Noam Chomsky</value><value>What's disconcerting is how Theresa May seems to be relishing introducing all this . This should be a highly regrettable step in a 'free' society. Why are satisfactory safeguards so unattainable?</value><value>Not guilty, sir. I did not say it.</value><value>The problem the government faces is to try and create the policy that treats us all as suspects that need to be under surveillance, but doesn't actually look like it. Terrorism has always been a useful tool for governments to create the need for greater powers to 'protect' us, yet has never actually addressed it, so it's the gift that keeps on giving. Stop terrorism and its value is lost.

</value><value>A 21st century fascist state isn't going to look like something out of the 1930s. Many would not recognise they were living in one.</value><value>Another Tory minister simply not up to the job.</value><value>Nothing?? Are you sure? Very sure?</value><value>It may be totally ineffective at preventing or intercepting organised crime and terrorism but will be a terrific way for the state to apply "leverage" against it's citizens, including those who stay within the law.</value><value>
</value><value>
</value><value>Of course the data is safe, do you really think Google would put such a valuable asset at risk?</value><value>Storing everyone's innner thoughts as expressed through web browsing is simply incompatible with privacy. If every electronic communication you make and every website you visit is logged, to be trawled at will by machines, there is no privacy of communication or information.</value><value>I'm sure there are or will be simple apps that will just trawl round the web and populate your history with 'junk' plus as anyone that's a bit of tech will use Tor or similar which will make it a bit harder.</value><value>and we are not already?</value><value>Don't hold your breath.</value><value>Give it time.</value><value>If there was nothing to stop the tories I am sure we would be in a fascist state by now under this current government.</value><value>It's difficult to know whether you are trolling, or just plain, old-fashioned ignorant. Either way, you are very, very wrong.</value><value>If you have nothing to hide, why do you constantly get posts deleted that imply you may be working directly for Tory HQ?</value><value>Anyway, perhaps you should read what the former Technical Director of the NSA thinks about bulk data collection... </value><value>I do not trust this government on anything, let alone something as vindictive as this. History will prove me right. How can the government lecture other countries and their spying and human rights and then go and do precisely the same sort of thing is beyond me</value><value>Well someone's got to tell us how to live our lives, and make sure we do as they say. I mean, it is 1984, isn't it?</value><value>But seriously, even if people have "nothing to hide" now, who gets to chose what's good and bad? Do we get to vote on it as it's our privacy as well when they inevitably want to include more and more things in the bad category? Do they have to justify whose data they get to look at and keep? Do they plan on keeping it safe or selling it on like so many other companies seem to do?</value><value>No member of the government or the police would ever, ever think of accidentally handing over incriminating information on fellow politicians or well-known members of the public obtained while "searching for terrorists" to the tabloid media, and certainly never do such a devious thing in exchange for a suspiciously thick brown envelope.</value><value>You may feel you have nothing to hide, but how would you feel about someone making a life-altering decision for you on the basis of the data available on you without consulting you, quite possibly without you ever getting to know about it? You may one day be turned down for a job owing to some detail in your past of which you are completely unaware. And all that thanks to some snooper bent on circumnavigating your democratic rights to a fair hearing. Food for thought? Or do you lack all imagination?</value><value>You swine! I almost split my stiches reading you are worried about governments keeping our private lives and data safe when most people happily post them all over Facebook and other sources.</value><value>

</value><value>Of course the data is safe, do you really think Google would put such a valuable asset at risk?</value><value>Storing everyone's innner thoughts as expressed through web browsing is simply incompatible with privacy.

Do we get to vote on it as it's our privacy as well when they inevitably want to include more and more things in the bad category? Do they have to justify whose data they get to look at and keep?

</value><value>A 21st century fascist state isn't going to look like something out of the 1930s.

Very sure?</value><value>It may be totally ineffective at preventing or intercepting organised crime and terrorism but will be a terrific way for the state to apply "leverage" against it's citizens, including those who stay within the law.</value><value>
</value><value>
</value><value>Of course the data is safe, do you really think Google would put such a valuable asset at risk?</value><value>Storing everyone's innner thoughts as expressed through web browsing is simply incompatible with privacy. If every electronic communication you make and every website you visit is logged, to be trawled at will by machines, there is no privacy of communication or information.</value><value>I'm sure there are or will be simple apps that will just trawl round the web and populate your history with 'junk' plus as anyone that's a bit of tech will use Tor or similar which will make it a bit harder.</value><value>and we are not already?</value><value>Don't hold your breath.</value><value>Give it time.</value><value>If there was nothing to stop the tories I am sure we would be in a fascist state by now under this current government.</value><value>It's difficult to know whether you are trolling, or just plain, old-fashioned ignorant.

I mean, it is 1984, isn't it?</value><value>But seriously, even if people have "nothing to hide" now, who gets to chose what's good and bad? Do we get to vote on it as it's our privacy as well when they inevitably want to include more and more things in the bad category? Do they have to justify whose data they get to look at and keep? Do they plan on keeping it safe or selling it on like so many other companies seem to do?</value><value>No member of the government or the police would ever, ever think of accidentally handing over incriminating information on fellow politicians or well-known members of the public obtained while "searching for terrorists" to the tabloid media, and certainly never do such a devious thing in exchange for a suspiciously thick brown envelope.</value><value>You may feel you have nothing to hide, but how would you feel about someone making a life-altering decision for you on the basis of the data available on you without consulting you, quite possibly without you ever getting to know about it? You may one day be turned down for a job owing to some detail in your past of which you are completely unaware. And all that thanks to some snooper bent on circumnavigating your democratic rights to a fair hearing. Food for thought? Or do you lack all imagination?</value><value>You swine! I almost split my stiches reading you are worried about governments keeping our private lives and data safe when most people happily post them all over Facebook and other sources.</value><value>
